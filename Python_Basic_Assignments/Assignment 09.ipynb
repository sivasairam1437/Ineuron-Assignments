    "#1. To what does a relative path refer?\n",
    "Ans. A relative path in Python is a path that describes the location of a directory relative to the entry point where you run the Python script.\n",
    "For example: if Absolute path to a file called stuff.txt is: C:/users/admin/docs/stuff.txt If my PWD is C:/users/admin/ , then the relative path to stuff.txt would be: docs/stuff.txt\n",
    "Note: PWD + relative path = absolute path"

    "\n",

    "*   ‘r+’ – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n",
    "*   ‘a’ – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file.\n",
    "*   ‘a+’ – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Whereas the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as you specify in the parenthesis. You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM.\n",
    "* The read() would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
    "* The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."
