It measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) of the target variable after the data is split based on a feature. Information gain is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the parent node and the weighted sum of the entropies of the child nodes. A feature with high information gain is selected because it leads to more homogeneous (pure) subsets of data, meaning it better separates the target classes."
