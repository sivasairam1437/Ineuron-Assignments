    "Synchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "In synchronous operations, tasks are executed one after the other, in a sequential order.\n",
    "A task needs to complete before the next one starts, creating a linear flow of execution.\n",
    "The program waits for each task to finish before moving on to the next, blocking further execution during that time.\n",
    "Synchronous operations are straightforward to understand and debug since the order of execution is predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "In asynchronous operations, tasks can start and finish independently of each other, without waiting for the previous task to complete.\n",
    "Asynchronous operations are often used for tasks that may take some time to complete, like fetching data from a server or reading a file.\n",
    "Instead of blocking further execution, asynchronous operations allow the program to continue working while waiting for tasks to complete.\n",

    "WebSocket APIs:\n",
    "WebSocket APIs enable full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange.\n",

    "A. Handling asynchronous code in JavaScript is essential for tasks that involve waiting for external resources, like network requests or file I/O, to complete. JavaScript provides several techniques for managing asynchronous operations to ensure that your code executes in the correct order and maintains responsiveness. Here are some common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks:\n",
    "Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are invoked once an asynchronous operation is complete. While effective, callback hell (nested callbacks) can lead to difficult-to-read code.\n",

Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript to manage asynchronous tasks, such as making network requests, reading files, or handling user interactions. They allow you to define what should happen once a certain task is complete.\n",

    "A. The try and catch blocks in JavaScript are used for error handling. They provide a structured way to handle potential errors that may occur during the execution of code. Errors can arise due to various reasons, such as invalid inputs, network issues, unexpected behavior, or programming mistakes. By using try and catch, you can gracefully handle errors, prevent crashes, and provide meaningful feedback to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the try and catch blocks is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detect Errors: The try block contains the code that you want to monitor for errors. If an error occurs within the try block, the code execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding catch block.\n",

    "Handle Errors: The catch block contains code that is executed when an error occurs within the associated try block. It allows you to handle the error in a controlled manner, perform necessary cleanup, or provide user-friendly error messages.\n",

    "\n",
    "Prevent Crashes: Using error handling prevents your application from abruptly crashing when an unexpected error occurs. It helps maintain the stability of your program.\n",

    "A. fetch is a built-in JavaScript function that provides an easy and modern way to make network requests to servers and retrieve data from APIs. It is a part of the Web API, specifically the Fetch API, which simplifies working with HTTP requests and responses. The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to the response to the request, allowing you to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can use the fetch function to make a basic GET request:\n",
    "\n",
    "javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\")\n",
    "  .then(response => {\n",
    "    if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "      throw new Error(\"Network response was not ok\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return response.json();\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .then(data => {\n",
    "    console.log(data);\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch(error => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Fetch error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "The fetch function initiates a GET request to the specified URL.\n",
    "The first .then() block checks if the response is okay (status code 200). If not, it throws an error.\n",
    "If the response is okay, the second .then() block parses the response using the .json() method, which returns a Promise resolving to the JSON data.\n",
    "Finally, the .catch() block handles any errors that occur during the fetch process.\n",
    "fetch allows you to configure various aspects of the request, such as headers, request method, and more. Here's an example of a POST request with custom headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "const requestOptions = {\n",
    "  method: \"POST\",\n",
    "  headers: {\n",
    "    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n",
    "    Authorization: \"Bearer myAccessToken\",\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  body: JSON.stringify({ key: \"value\" }),\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", requestOptions)\n",
    "  .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "  .then(data => {\n",
    "    console.log(data);\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch(error => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Fetch error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "The fetch function is widely used for making asynchronous network requests in modern web development. It provides a more flexible and consistent way to work with APIs compared to older approaches like using XMLHttpRequest."

    "A. To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using the async and await syntax, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the async Keyword: Use the async keyword before the function keyword to declare that the function is asynchronous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the await Keyword: Inside the asynchronous function, you can use the await keyword before expressions that return Promises. This will pause the execution of the function until the awaited Promise is resolved or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Value: An asynchronous function returns a Promise implicitly, regardless of whether you explicitly return a Promise. The resolved value of the returned Promise will be the value returned from the function, or the rejected value if an error is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "async function myAsyncFunction() {\n",
    "  // Asynchronous operations...\n",
    "  const result = await someAsyncOperation();\n",
    "  return result;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Let's break down each step with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "// Simulated asynchronous operation\n",
    "function fetchUserData() {\n",
    "  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Call the asynchronous function\n",
    "displayUserData();\n",
    "In this example, the displayUserData function is defined using the async keyword. It uses the await keyword to pause the execution until the fetchUserData Promise is resolved. The resolved user data is then logged to the console. If there's an error, it's caught in the catch block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async/await makes asynchronous code easier to read and write, resembling synchronous code flow while retaining the benefits of non-blocking operations."
