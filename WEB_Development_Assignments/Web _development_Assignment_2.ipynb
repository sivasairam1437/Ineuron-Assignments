    "A. The Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that defines how elements on a web page are visually represented and how their dimensions are calculated. It describes how the content of an HTML element is surrounded by padding, borders, and margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Box Model consists of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Content: This is the actual content of the HTML element, such as text, images, or other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the element's border. It provides extra spacing inside the element. Padding can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) using CSS properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Border: The border surrounds the padding and content, giving the element a visible boundary. You can control the width, style, and color of the border using properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin: Margins are the space outside the element's border. They create spacing between neighboring elements. Like padding, margins can also be set for each side separately using properties like margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left."

    "General Sibling Selectors: Style elements that are siblings of a common parent.\n",
    "Attribute Selectors: Style elements based on their attributes.\n",
    "Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Style elements based on state or specific content parts.\n",
    "Advantages include specificity, efficient targeting, separation of style and content, and easier maintenance. Selectors offer a versatile way to apply styles in various scenarios."

    "A. vw and vh are units of measurement in CSS that refer to viewport width and viewport height, respectively. They are relative units, which means they are based on the size of the browser viewport, or the visible area of the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "vw (Viewport Width): This unit represents 1% of the width of the viewport. So, 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. If the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1vw would be 10 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "vh (Viewport Height): Similarly, this unit represents 1% of the height of the viewport. So, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. If the viewport height is 800 pixels, 1vh would be 8 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using vw and vh units can be quite handy for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. For example, you can set font sizes, margins, paddings, or even widths of elements using these units, ensuring that they adjust proportionally as the viewport dimensions change. However, it's important to test and fine-tune these values across various devices to ensure the desired layout and readability are maintained."

Elements with higher z-index values are displayed on top of elements with lower values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how z-index functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking Contexts: The stacking order is managed within stacking contexts. A stacking context is created by an element with a position value of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky, along with a few other properties like opacity and CSS transforms. Elements inside a stacking context are positioned relative to each other, but they don't affect elements in other stacking contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Index Values: The z-index property accepts numeric values (both positive and negative), indicating the element's stacking order. Elements with higher z-index values are stacked above those with lower values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto Stacking: If z-index is not explicitly set, elements follow the order they appear in the HTML document, with later elements stacking above earlier ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Siblings within Stacking Context: Within a single stacking context, siblings are positioned based on their z-index values. The stacking order applies to sibling elements only; parent and child elements don't directly affect each other's stacking order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking Context Nesting: A child element with a higher z-index value than its parent can still be positioned behind a sibling of the parent with a higher z-index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positioned vs Non-Positioned: Non-positioned elements (those with position: static) are considered at the bottom of the stacking order. Adding positioning (e.g., relative, absolute, fixed) creates a new stacking context, and the z-index of those elements affects their position in the stacking order."
